This codebase is a work in progress containing a modular blockchain, a proof of concept 'mail' service, a client for the mail service and some test rigs.

For a more general discussion of the asado code base see the Wiki
    
The core code modules are ... 
 
- [common](https://github.com/mcsherrylabs/sss.asado/tree/master/sss.asado-common)
- [ledger](https://github.com/mcsherrylabs/sss.asado/tree/master/sss.asado-ledger)

- [node](https://github.com/mcsherrylabs/sss.asado/tree/master/sss.asado-node)

  
## Testing
There are automated tests for the non reactive code and the state machine at the heart of the state transitions.
